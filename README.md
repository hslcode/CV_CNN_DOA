### Power Normalization for Covariance Matrices @ 2025.03
To generalize to different hardware platforms and power levels, we strongly recommend power-normalizing the covariance matrix before model training and inference, using the following formula:

#### Mathematical Definition
Given sampling covariance matrix (SCM) $\hat{R} \in \mathbb{C}^{Batch \times M \times M}$ :  
```math
\hat{R}_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{\hat{R}}{\max\left(\text{diag}(\hat{R})\right) + \epsilon}
```
